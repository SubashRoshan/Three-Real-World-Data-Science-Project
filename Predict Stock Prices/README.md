# Problem Statement 

Time series analysis enables us to visualize trends in stock prices, seasonality, autocorrelations and hence predict subsequent prices and trends. These insights are essential for many financial and non financial companies, portfolio analysis etc. In this notebook, I have explored various feature engineering techniques and models exclusive to time series data.

5.Volume: Volume of shares traded on the current day.

6.Turnover: It is a measure of stock liquidity calculated by dividing the total number of shares traded over a period by the average number of shares outstanding for the period.
