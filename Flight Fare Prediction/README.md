# Problem Statement

Predicting flight prices without having proper idea about particular airline company is near too impossible, specially when you want to book any flight real quick. Using Machine Learning approach it becomes quite easy as the model predicts that how much you need to spent on your flight expenses by getting rid of all unnecessary calculations and brain scratching thoughts. From user's point of view this is somehow proves to be a profitable project model as user can select from a wide range of airline companies whichever of their choice is and decide budget for their ongoing journey without spending anything extra.

Size of Training Set: 10683

* Airline - The name of the airline.
* Date_of_Journey - The date of the journey.
* Source - The source from which the service begins.
* Destination - The destination where the service ends.
* Route - The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.
* Dep_Time - The time when the journey starts from the source.
* Arrival_Time - Time of arrival at the destination.
* Duration - Total duration of the flight.
* Total_Stops - Total stops between the source and destination.
* Additional_Info - Additional information about the flight
* Price - The price of the ticket

# Approach

* Understanding data and Data Preprocessing
* Removing missing value records and duplicated data
* Extracting Features from the Dataset
* Handling Categorical data and Performing Feature Encoding
* Perfom One Hot Encoding and Label Encoding on data
* Outlier Detection
* Feature Selection
* Applying random forest on data and automate predictions
* Play with multiple algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression and k - Nearest Neighbors)
* Cross validate the model
