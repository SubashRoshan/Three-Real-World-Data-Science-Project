* **Project #1 : Predict Price of Airlines Industry**

Developed a Machine learning model using Scikit learn Random Forest Regressor which will predict flight fare for certain cities and compare the performance with different models.

* **Project #2 : Predict the strength of a Password**

This model makes use of Natural language processing to predict whether typed password is weak or strong using logistic regression and Random Forest Classifier.

* **Project #3 : Predict Stock Prices using Automated Time Series Algorithm**

Developed a Machine learning model using Scikit learn Random Forest Regressor which will predict flight fare for certain cities and compare the performance with different models.
